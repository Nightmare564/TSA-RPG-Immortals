# TSA-RPG-Immortals
All the extra files like the viewPlayerDown and sprVillageWolf are supposed to be in the folder Sprites, but it was too big to upload.
Try to upload it to GameMaker Studio 2, but if it doesn't work, we have to ask someone (Sabeen).
If it works, clone it so you don't actually mess it up. Use pull requests when editing.
There's also a lot of test things in it, like the Village Wolf is just a gray box, since Matthew isn't done drawing that.
Remember not to download this file -- it's not in the actual game -- it'll probably bring up an error.
